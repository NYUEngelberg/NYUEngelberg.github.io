Glam3D.org brings together best practices for conceiving, designing, and executing 3D Open Access programs at GLAM institutions.  It is an evolving resource and **we encourage you to email us at engelberg.center@nyu.edu** if you have suggestions for improvements, additions, or corrections.

Glam3D.org is a project of the [Engelberg Center on Innovation Law & Policy at NYU Law](https://www.law.nyu.edu/centers/engelberg).  It was originally created in 2020 by Sketchfab Cultural Heritage Lead [Thomas Flynn](https://twitter.com/nebulousflynn), Engelberg Center Fellow [Neal Stimler](https://www.law.nyu.edu/centers/engelberg/team/stimler), and Engelberg Center Executive Director [Michael Weinberg](https://www.law.nyu.edu/centers/engelberg/team/weinberg), in consultation with a wide variety of 3D digitization and Open Access experts from around the world.  Glam3D.org could not exist without the generous and valuable feedback from this community.
